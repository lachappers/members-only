# Project: Members Only! - and chat

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only

In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

If you want to add your own stylistic flourishes, consider it extra credit.
